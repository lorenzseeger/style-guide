# Style Guide

This is Style Guide. A style guide theme based on GetKirby, a file-based CMS.
Easy to setup. Easy to use. Flexible as hell.

## Setup

Style Guide is easy to setup. Just clone the project and cd into the folder. Because I use Gulp to write SASS styles just use the terminal and type “$ npm install” and the necessary modules will be installed. Just make sure you have Node running globally.
